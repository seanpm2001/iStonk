# [iStonk](#iStonk)

`üìàÔ∏èüì∑Ô∏èüåêÔ∏èüíæÔ∏è iStonk is tool that does a reverse image search on uploaded image/video files, and shows you results for a version without a watermark/other addon.`

***

## [How it works](#How-it-works)

If you are familiar with browsing images on the Internet, you are probably familiar with images that have watermarks (text/logos) covering the image (notably ShutterStock, iStock, and many others) some people still want to use the image, but don't want the watermark. Most of the time, there is a separate version of the exact same image without the watermark (most of the time, not even owned or created by those who add a watermark to it, and then sometimes charge money for the version without a watermark)

iStonk is simple. You simply upload/select an image or video file, and the program does a reverse image search, giving you a list of images that don't contain the watermark (when possible)

This is better than having to manually scrub the watermark out through editing, as that takes CPU, energy, skill, and time. If you still can't find a version without a watermark, you should try to scrub it out yourself and upload it, so that iStonk can be more powerful.

## [Reverse video search](#Reverse-video-search)

This feature is coming soon. The plan is similar to reverse image searching, but for short videos (30 seconds or shorter) support for longer videos may be possible in the future.

## [Reverse image search](#Reverse-image-search)

Reverse image search is the core feature of iStonk. See below for supported reverse image search services.

### [Supported reverse image search services](#Supported-reverse-image-search-services)

iStonk plans to have its own reverse image searching service in the future, but 3rd party options will always be able to use, especially while it doesn't have one. Planned supported reverse image search services include:

- [`TinEye`](https://tineye.com/)
- [:octocat: `Suggest another one`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/iStonk/issues/new)

Please recommend more reverse image searching services that are privacy friendly. Google Reverse Image search will not be supported, as it does not respect users right to privacy.

## [Storage of content](#Storage-of-content)

By default, iStonk does not collect any data that is uploaded or downloaded to/from it. Reverse searching is done only on existing content. And, like all of my other projects, iStonk does not collect personal or sensitive data.

***

## [Etymology](#Etymology)

iStonk is a play on iStock, a notorious watermarked image host. It is also a reference to the Internet meme: "stonks"

The `i` before `Stonk` (the `i` being lower case, and the second letter being capitalized) is a common naming motif that was popularized by American luxury computer company `Apple Inc.` who popularized it with products such as iTunes, iMac, and iPhone.

This project is not affiliated with or owned by either iStock or Apple Inc. and it never will be.
